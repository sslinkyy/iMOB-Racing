        <p>At iMOB Racing, our ambition is to become the premier team in the racing industry. Comprising dedicated racecar modders and enthusiasts, we specialize in time attack racing while also participating in 4x4, rally, drifting, off-road, street bikes, dirt bikes, and crosskarts. We pride ourselves on being 100% built, not bought, with a commitment to modifying and customizing any vehicle.</p>
