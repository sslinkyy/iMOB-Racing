        <h2>Top Secret iMOB Racing Secrets</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secret #1:</strong> Our lead driver once drove an entire race with a flat tire... and still won!</li>
            <li><strong>Secret #2:</strong> The team's chief mechanic is convinced that talking to the car engines improves their performance. He's been caught singing lullabies to them more than once.</li>
            <li><strong>Secret #3:</strong> Our race cars have a secret compartment filled with snacks for those long, grueling races. Who says you can't race and munch at the same time?</li>
            <li><strong>Secret #4:</strong> The iMOB Racing team holds an annual go-kart race where the mechanics, drivers, and even the management compete in costume. Last year's winner? A mechanic dressed as a giant banana.</li>
            <li><strong>Secret #5:</strong> We once had a driver who believed that wearing mismatched socks brought good luck. He never lost a race while wearing them!</li>
            <li><strong>Secret #6:</strong> Our team mascot, a stuffed squirrel named "Speedy," has a tiny helmet and racing suit. He's been to every race and is considered our good luck charm.</li>
            <li><strong>Secret #7:</strong> During testing, one of our drivers accidentally discovered that humming the theme song to "Mission Impossible" improved his lap times by 5%.</li>
            <li><strong>Secret #8:</strong> Our fastest car, nicknamed "The Rocket," actually has a small rocket decal hidden under the hood. It's our little secret boost of confidence.</li>
            <li><strong>Secret #9:</strong> The iMOB Racing team once built a race car entirely out of LEGO bricks for a charity event. It wasn't the fastest, but it was definitely the most fun.</li>
            <li><strong>Secret #10:</strong> Before every race, our drivers perform a secret handshake ritual that involves high-fives, fist bumps, and a choreographed dance move. It's all about team spirit!</li>
